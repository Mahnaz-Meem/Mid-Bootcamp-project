## About
A Tableau stories presentation displaying information about how to chose from different crops has been presented. The data has been obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).
**Please note that this data corresponds to only from India. But with machine learning models this could be replicated for different countries and parameters to predict the optimum crop choice for a farmer.**
To know more about the the dataset and other approaches, please check [here.](https://github.com/Mahnaz-Meem/Harvestify)

Thus, this only reflects **part of the reality in reference to crops produced in the world.** For sure there exists more data from different researchers, which could be achieved by more research on this topic. If so, there could be more avenues to explore.

In the python codes, I have tried to explore the data and tried to find if there is any correlation. Since K and P have more correlation, I have tried to explore those with different plotting.
I have plotted each of the numerical variables against all the crop choices to find out according to this dataset for a given value which crop to choose. A farmer can choose which crop is optimum in his/her soil to plant depending on that information.

After that I built 4 different models to represent the data. 3 of them were with Logistic Regression and one of them were with KNN. However, KNN gave the highest accuracy for this.

In future, I would like to explore more sophisticated and practical models.
