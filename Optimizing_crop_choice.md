## About
A Tableau stories presentation displaying information about how to chose from different crops has been presented. The data has been obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).
**Please note that this data corresponds to only from India. But with machine learning models this could be replicated for different countries and parameters to predict the optimum crop choice for a farmer.**
To know more about the the dataset and other approaches, please check [here.](https://github.com/Mahnaz-Meem/Harvestify)

Thus, this only reflects **part of the reality in reference to crops produced in the world.** For sure there exists more data from different researchers, which could be achieved by more research on this topic. If so, there could be more avenues to explore.
